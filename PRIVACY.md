# Privacy Policy

Mothership on Main does not collect, store, sell, or transmit personal data to the author or any third party.

What the extension does

- Stores your configuration (links, sections, quotes, search engines, layout) in `chrome.storage.sync` so it can sync across signed-in browser profiles.
- Stores uploaded images and favicon overrides locally in `chrome.storage.local`.

Network behavior

- Search queries are sent directly to the search engine you select.
- Link clicks open the URL you configured.
- Favicons are retrieved from the target site when available; if not, the extension may request a favicon from Google's `s2` favicon service.

No telemetry

- There is no analytics, telemetry, or “phone home” behavior.
- No data is uploaded to any server controlled by the author.

Open source

- The full source code is available in this repository for inspection.
